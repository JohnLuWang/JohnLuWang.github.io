<b>Abstract:</b>
Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is promising for producing metallic glasses (MGs) for its extremely high cooling rate and ability to manufacture complex geometrical components. However, the crystallization of MGs under different L-PBF parameters is not fully investigated, which has influences on the mechanical properties. In this study, we develop a multi-physics thermal-fluid flow model for the L-PBF process of MGs, run simulation cases for single tracks, and then analyze the molten pool morphology and crystallization behavior in the center and edge of the track, as well as the heat affected zone. The simulation results are validated against the experimental results in the literature and have provided deeper insight into the crystallization phenomenon observed in the experiments.
