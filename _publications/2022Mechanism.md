<b>Abstract:</b>
During metal additive manufacturing, the porosity of the as-built part deteriorates the mechanical property and even hinders the further application of metal additive manufacturing. Particularly, the mechanisms of keyhole pores associated with the keyhole fluctuation are not fully understood. To reveal the mechanisms of the keyhole pores formation, we adopt a multiphysics thermal-fluid flow model incorporating heat transfer, liquid flow, metal evaporation, Marangoni effect, and Darcyâ€™s law to simulate the keyhole pore formation process, and the results are validated with the in situ X-ray images. The simulation results present the instant bubble formation due to the keyhole instability and motion of the instant bubble pinning on the solidification front. Furthermore, comparing the keyhole pore formation under different laser scanning speeds shows that the keyhole pore is sensitive to the manufacturing parameters. Additionally, the simulation under a low ambient pressure shows the feasibility of improving the keyhole stability to reduce and even avoid the formation of keyhole pores.
