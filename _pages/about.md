Hi! I am Lu, a Ph.D Candidate at the National Univerisity of Singapore in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. I am working on the research of simulation and ameliorating of molten pool flow during Metal Additive Manufacturing under the guidance of [Dr. Wentao YAN](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/yan-wentao/). My Ph.D research is studying the formation mechanisms of the keyhole pores by molten pool flow during Metal Additive Manufacturing, ameliorating the molten pool flow with the external magnetic field to improve the quality of the as-built part. Our study has made some progress and published papers on npj Computational Materials, Physical Review Applied, Journal of Mechanics and Physics of Solids, Additive Manufacturing, etc.
